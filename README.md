# [404 IDE] 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Keerthana A R]

### Project Description
A satirical IDE that parodies the frustrating developer experience by replacing keywords with absurd alternatives, generating fake errors, and trolling users with passive-aggressive tooltips and random crashes - because sometimes coding feels like a cosmic joke anyway!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Developers are having too much fun coding and feeling too confident about their abilities. The world clearly needs an IDE that actively undermines developer self-esteem, replaces sensible keywords with ridiculous alternatives like turning "console.log" into "speakToTheVoid", and makes every coding session an exercise in existential dread.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
404 IDE - Where code goes to die! An IDE that trolls you harder than Stack Overflow comments. It features keyword replacement (goodbye "function", hello "perhapsFunction"), fake error generation, passive-aggressive tooltips, random UI corruption, fake crash screens, and a metrics panel tracking your declining confidence and hope levels in real-time!
